usage:

> python fiver_alpha_psi.py [alpha]

or 

> python fiver_linear.py [alpha]

Givern multiple arguments, fiver_linear.py can work with mpirun and run several different alphas in parallel 

for example:

> python fiver_alpha_psi.py 0.1
> mpirun -n 3 fiver_linear.py 0.0 0.2 0.4

Parallel version of the code fiver_parallel splits the computational domain in equal parts and uses mpi to calculate them separately. So far, the time step decreases with dx quadratically, that makes parallel computations inefficient.
